# CCETPaperBank

CCETPaperBank is a simple android app that contains resources to help out students in preparing for their exams. 

## Overview

This app was created as a project for a IPD Expo (Innovative Product Design) 2018. This was a one month training program in which I learnt android from the very beginning and created this app. 

This app provides a simple UI with tabs and a navigation drawer. Currently only Previous Year 1 papers have been uploaded.
